        <p class = "text"> <strong>Kok-Jailau </strong> is the one of the wondeful places I have ever seen in my life. In the end of the May of the current year as I live in dormitory with guys , we have decided to visit this place. I was in as my exams were passed. So, we got ready, we got the neccessary things like food, water e.t.c for our travel. And in the early morning we leaved our dormitory and went to mountains. First the weather was good, but suddenly it was changed, and the rain started. For us it was not good, but for our luck we have met the <em>other people</em> who helped us not to get the cold and with other difficulties that we got.<br>
            It was exciting and the things that I liked most are : <br>
            <ul>
                <li> Mountains </li>
                <li> Beatiful Nature </li>
                <li> Air </li>
                
            </ul>
