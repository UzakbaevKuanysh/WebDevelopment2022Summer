    <h1>Music by Walter De La Mare</h1>
    <p>When music sounds, gone is the earth I know <br>
    And all her lovely things even lovelier grow;<br>
    Her flowers in vision flame, her forest trees<br>
    Lift burdened branches, stilled with ecstasies.<br>
    <br>
    When music sounds, out of the water rise <br>
    Naiads whose beauty dims my waking eyes,<br>
    Rapt in strange dreams burns each enchanted face, <br>
    With solemn echoing stirs their dwelling-place.<br>
    <br>
    When music sounds, all that I was I am <br>
    Ere to this haunt of brooding dust I came;<br>
    And from Timeâ€™s woods break into distant song <br>
    The swift-winged hours, as I hasten along.<br>
